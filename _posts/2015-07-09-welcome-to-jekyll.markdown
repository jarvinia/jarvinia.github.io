<!--excerpt-->
First Jekyll post. Welcome to my blog!
<!--excerpt-->
</p>
You’ll find this post in your <kbd>_posts</kbd> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <kbd>jekyll serve</kbd>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

<!--break-->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the <kbd>_posts</kbd> directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def test:
    print "test python"

{% endhighlight %}

{% gist parkr/931c1c8d465a04042403 %}
